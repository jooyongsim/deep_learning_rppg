## Setup
For setting anaconda environment, please refer "requirements.txt" file or "environment.yml" file.

## Dataset
Locate PURE datasets 01-01, 02-01, 09-01, 10-01 ../PURE.
For example as following:
```
rppg_project/rppg_deep
rppg_project/PURE/01-01
rppg_project/PURE/02-01
rppg_project/PURE/09-01
rppg_project/PURE/10-01
```

Data can be downloaded from the Photo folder of the lab NAS. 
To run the notebook code above, you only need to download 01-01, 02-01, 09-01, and 10-01.

## Test
Look into "PURE_PhysNetED_v7_SIM_Clean.ipynb"
